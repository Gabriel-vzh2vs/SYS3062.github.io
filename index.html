  <strong><b>Course Description: </b></strong>
          <p> A first course in the theory & practice of discrete-event and continuous simulation. Monte Carlo methods, generating random numbers & variates, spreadsheet add-ins & applications, sampling distributions & confidence intervals, input analysis & distribution fitting. Discrete-event dynamic systems, modeling, simulation logic & data structures, output analysis, model verification & validation, comparing alternative systems, simulation optimization, case studies. Prerequisite: CS 2100, APMA 3100, and APMA 3120.<br />
          <br />The modeling and simulation techniques and methods we might cover include Monte Carlo Methods, and Distribution Modelling, Output Analysis, Statistical Testing and Correction Methods (i.e: Test for Randomness, and Bonferroni Correction), Discrete Event Simulation, Agent-Based Modelling, System Dynamics, and Debugging. We hope that our course provides a foundation for future learning and application. <br />

  <strong><b>Learning Objectives: </b></strong> 
     <ul>
      <p> In your professional careers you will undoubtedly encounter projects and problems where simulation is an option for a solution. The purpose of this course is to provide you with a foundation covering theory and practice for stochastic simulations as a method for the design and analysis of systems. </p>
  </div>
      <div class="col-6 p-2" id="prereqs" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Prerequisites: </b></strong> 
        <p>SYS 2001, APMA/MATH 3100, and APMA/STAT 3120 or equivalent (you have a question of what is equivalent, please write to Professor Mortveit and Gabe).
        It is recommended that students have a basic command of linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics. We will use Python for simulation and VS Code for our programming sessions. Student are encouraged to familiarize themselves with <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science">Python programming</a>, <a href="https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpy_intro/index.html"> SimPy</a> or <a href = https://salabim.org/manual/salabim.pdf> Salabim </a>, and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs"> VS Code</a>.

        </ul>
      </p>
  
      <p id="homeworks" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Homework: </b></strong>
        <p>On Tuesday morning at 10:45 am ET, bi-weekly homework based upon course and laboratory notes will be posted via the Assignments feature on the course Gradescope site. 
        These assignments provide exercises based on the material covered in class and provide the foundation for the exams and projects. 
        <br /> <br />The assignments are designed to assess your knowledge on modelling techniques and their mechanics. 
        These assignments should be done individually or with assistance in Office Hours, include an honor pledge, and be completed by Friday night at 11:59 pm ET, typically a week later. 
        While there is no time limit for these assignments, they are designed not to take more than 3 days. Laboratory sessions are excellent practice for exams and real-world analysis and should be started early. </p>
      </p>

      <p id="hands-on activities" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Hands-On Activities: </b></strong>
        <p>Hands-on activities will be used throughout the course to allow you to practice the methods covered in class, recognize opportunities to apply them in your own work, and discover their shortcomings.
        Students can still participate in the activities if participating online and will submit their activity on Collab under "Assignments".</p>
      </p>
  
      <p id="projects" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Projects: </b></strong>
        <p>The class will have two group projects on real-world topics and data sets. These exercises provide a real-world context for what we learn and are open-ended problem solving experiences that illustrate the concepts of modelling and simulation in practice.
        Hence, they provide the opportunity to demonstrate understanding of class material using real data to solve a goal-directed problem. Projects are designed to teach students how to perform a detailed analysis as well as how to proficiently communicate results as in a technical document and presentation. </p>
      </p>
  
      <p id="Exams" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Exams: </b></strong>
        <p>Exams are based entirely on classroom notes and discussions, readings, projects, and laboratory assignments. Each exam will be open book requiring analytical problem solving. 
          The final examination is cumulative. Example questions for both exams are in the in-progress Textbook.</p>

       <p id="submission" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Submission and Late Submission Policy: </b></strong> 
        <p>On the day any assignment is due you must submit an electronic copy <strong>in pdf (NOT doc or docx, etc.)</strong> along with source code on the GradeScope site and pledge your submission.
        No late assignments will be accepted in this class, unless the student has procured special accommodations for warranted circumstances. <br />
        <br /> We will be accommodating also due to exceptional circumstances but this is a large class so please make sure this is truly warranted and contact us as soon as possible.
        In any case you will do better to submit an incomplete assignment rather than a late one.</p>
        <!--Please take into account that due to the ongoing pandemic the grading policies of this class have already been relaxed to drop the lowest scored lab from the final
        grade computations, this includes an assignment with a grade of zero that was not submitted for whatever reason. -->
      </p>
      <p id="illness" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Illness: </b></strong> 
        <p>We try to create a safe environment, not only for our students, but also for our faculty and our staff. To that end, please stay home or in 
          your dorm room if you are ill with or are symptomatic for any communicable disease. We would rather you stay home and work something out with 
          us for making up work or taking an exam than for an illness to spread through the class. If you believe you are sick, immediately contact Student 
          Health for appropriate treatment or testing at <a href="https://www.healthyhoos.virginia.edu/">HealthyHoos</a>. </p>
      </p>
     
      </p>
      <p id="religious" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Religious Accommodations: </b></strong> 
        <p>It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence 
          when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p>
        <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to us by private message on Piazza
          as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact 
          the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</a> or 434-924-3200.</p>
      </p>

      <p id="accessibility" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Accessibility Statement: </b></strong> 
        <p> It is our goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. 
          If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with us outside of class so we can explore potential options. 
          Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, 
          including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at 
          <a href="mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu>cmacmasters@virginia.edu</a> to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the SDAC website: <a href="sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu">sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>. 
          If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send us your accommodation letter and meet with us so we can develop an implementation plan together.</p>
      </p>
      
       <p id="integrity" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Academic Integrity Statement: </b></strong> 
        <p>"The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. 
        We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, 
        cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can 
        destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles 
        of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 
        Students are expected to be familiar with the <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud">university honor code</a>, 
        including the section on academic fraud." <br />
        <br />In summary, if assignments are individual then no two students should submit the same source code -- any overlap in source code of 
        sufficient similarity will be flagged as failure to abide to the Honor Code. You can discuss, you can share resources, you can talk
        about the assignment but not share code as this incurs an honor code violation.
        Regardless of circumstances, we will assume that any source code, text, or images submitted alongside reports or projects are of the authorship
        of the individual students unless otherwise explicitly stated through appropriate means. Any missing information regarding sources will be regarded
        as a failure to abide by the academic integrity statement even if that was not the intent. Please be careful clearly stating
        what is your original work and what is not in all assignments.</p>

             path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career 
             development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.</p>
       </p>

<p id="discrimination" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Harassment, Discrimination and Interpersonal Violence:</b></strong>
<p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. 
  If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website 
  that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
  <p>The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  
    UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, 
    marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, 
    religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. </p>
<p>If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to Just Report It 
  (<a href="justreportit.virginia.edu">justreportit.virginia.edu</a>) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.</p>
  <p>If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to 
    Counseling & Psychological Services (“CAPS”) and Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates (for students of all genders).</p>
<p>As your instructors, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As faculty members, we are
  responsible employees, which means that we are required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report 
  to us to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and 
  support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. </p>
